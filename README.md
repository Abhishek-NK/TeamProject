# CS2810 Team Project, Team 5
The COO of Oaxaca has reached out to us to see if there is some way we can help them mitigate
their issues by reducing the staffing and/or training needs of their restaurants with technology. Our
goal is to look at their existing processes and identify ways in which we can use technology to help
them grow faster.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


```
Python
```
```
Django
```



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

To install Python and Django:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-django
```

You can test that the installation was successful by typing:

```
$ django-admin --version

2.0.1
```


## Running the tests

Django's unit tests use a Python standard library module: **unittest**.

Tests that require a database will not use the real production database, separate blank databases are created for the tests and then destroyed after the tests have been completed, regardless of whether the tests pass or fail.
 
Tests are located within each Django application as a tests.py file.


Run all tests within the project using the test command of the projectâ€™s manage.py utility:

```
$ python manage.py test
```

and then you will see something like this:

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 6 tests in 0.018s

OK

```

To run the server type the following command:

```
$ python manage.py runserver
